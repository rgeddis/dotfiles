Dotfiles
========

Hi!  This is the repository for my dotfiles setup, including:

- Highly customised vim installation with vundle + plugins (see vimrc)
- Solarized colourscheme for both vim and gnome-terminal [desktop].
- Installation of system-wide packages (see packages.txt) [desktop].
- Installation of python packages (see requirements.txt).
- YouCompleteMe for clang-based semantic completion of code [desktop].
- The "libgcrypt11" package for ubuntu 15.04 (for spotify, gah) [desktop].

Please refer the simple/extended usage to see how this works.

Installation
------------

- Clone
- Execute setup.sh (from anywhere, see extended usage for more options).
- Enjoy!

The default setup will install for desktop environments and MUST be run under
sudo in order to install system packages (etc.)

Extended Usage
--------------

```
Usage: ./setup.sh [options]
  -e <stages(s)> A CSV-list of stages to exclude (default: ).
                   See -i for a full list of stages.
  -f             Force setup (by default anything that has already been setup
                   before will be skipped.)
  -m <mode>      Mode to setup (desktop/server, default: desktop)
                   This influences what is installed, where server mode
                   is for headless or terminal-only servers, possibly
                   without sudo access.  See -i for a full list of stages.
  -i <stage(s)> A CSV-list of stages to execute (default: all)
                   Stages (asterisks are desktop-only):
                    - dotfiles: Link dotfiles.
                    * colours: Setup terminal colours.
                    * fonts: Setup terminal fonts.
                    * libgcrypt11: Setup libgcrypt11 (Ubuntu 15.04+ only).
                    * packages: Install packages from packages.txt
                    - pip: Install pip/python packages from requirements.txt

                    * ycm: Install YouCompleteMe (requires vundle installation).
                   E.g. to only link dotfiles, use -i dotfiles.
  -h           Display usage (this text)

Making Changes
--------------

If you want to submit changes back then please issue a pull request.
Procedure:

- Fork the repository and make your changes on a new feature branch.
- Raise a pull request to merge from that feature branch.
- Detail what the changes are for and whether they are specific to OS/Env.

Note: If the changes are customisation rather than fixes to the scripts or for
additional features then I'm not likely to accept them - I might split the repo
into two in the future to make this easier (i.e. one for scripts, one for the
customisations).

USE THESE DOTFILES AT YOUR OWN RISK.  These dotfiles meet my own requirements,
but they may not meet yours (or worse, ruin them).  Subsequent changes may break
your environment and I cannot be held responsible for it doing so (feel free to
send gripes about it though, and I'll try to help fix it.)
